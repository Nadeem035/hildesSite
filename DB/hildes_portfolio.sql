The goal of our company is to build customized software applications and management information systems that meet the highest standards of quality. We “get into your head” and develop a deep understanding of your needs, wants and expectations. The result is an exceptional product.'),
(2, 'Do you do software testing, verifications and QA services?', 'Yes, we do a huge amount of software testing: QA, system testing, functionality & feature testing, integration testing, regression testing, web software testing, compatibility testing on various platforms, load and performance testing, test case preparations, execution of test cases, reporting, etc.'),
(3, 'Do you provide post-development maintenance?', 'Yes, we do support all software we design on the basis of a product license. This generally includes bug-tracking and fixing. Feature enhancements and developments are handled.'),
(4, 'How do you deal with urgent bug fixing?', 'We are doing our best to avoid programming errors in products delivered to our customers. However, everybody familiar with software development practice knows that from time to time bugs appear even in the highest quality products. We are trying to fix bugs as soon as possible.'),
(5, 'How detailed set of requirements do you require from us?', 'It’s an interactive process. For successful design project realization we need a detailed specification. You should point all your preferences concerning style, color gamut, shapes. Also we need to know your project specification, description of the application the design will be developed for. It would be great to have demo versions of your programs for further design development.'),
(6, 'How can I monitor and control project development progress?', 'There is a number of approaches for reviewing status of the project: The Internet allows us to communicate with your as easily as if we werenext door. We are going to implement PHP GroupWare system soon to provide you direct secure access to our site where you can participate in your project discussion database, download/upload all relevant to the project information. We will provide you with regular status reports based on time sheets from our developers. Regular updates of the schedule with specified current status provides upper level view to the state of project. Once again the most convenient ways are E-mail, Skype, Mobile. Lots of tools allow you to talk directly to your programmer team in real time. It is also possible to appoint a team leader, if you prefer to have a single point of contact. Based on reviewing these status artifacts you may propose changes to the project process, features, etc.'),
(7, 'What time zone is HilDes in?', 'We are located in +5 GMT time zone. The exact time of contact is certainly whatever suits you best, but it is best to make a time at which you can meet daily. A planned daily meeting makes the development process go much more smoothly.'),
